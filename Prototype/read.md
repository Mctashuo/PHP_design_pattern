Every time you add a product
family, you are forced to create an associated concrete creator (the BloggsCal encoders are matched by
BloggsCommsManager, for example). In a system that grows fast enough to encompass many products,
maintaining this kind of relationship can quickly become tiresome.

One way of avoiding this dependency is to use PHPâ€™s clone keyword to duplicate existing concrete
products.
